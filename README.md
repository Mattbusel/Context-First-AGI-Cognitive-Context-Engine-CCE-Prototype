 Context-First AGI: Cognitive Context Engine (CCE) Prototype
Overview
The Context-First AGI project is a radical departure from traditional LLM-based architectures. Instead of generating language via token prediction, this system constructs thought first â€” modeling cognitive processes more aligned with how humans understand, prioritize, and synthesize the world.

Our mission:

Build a system that understands before it speaks.

This AGI approach is designed to simulate true cognition, using modular knowledge representations and evolving systemic reasoning before producing any linguistic output.

 Core Components
1.  Knowledge Nodes
Discrete conceptual modules representing ideas, systems, and behaviors.

Each node includes:

Temporal context

Systemic relationships (political, economic, historical, etc.)

Resource + energy flow mappings

Behavioral and psychological interpretations

ðŸ”§ Stored as multi-dimensional embeddings that capture the what, why, and how.

2.  Cognitive Context Engine (CCE)
A reasoning engine that constructs evolving models of reality.

Links new data to existing knowledge

Detects contradictions and cognitive dissonance

Updates forecasts and recalibrates risk

Produces compressed, interpretable mental models

 cognitive_context_engine.py contains the core logic.

3.  Thought Compression
Compresses high-dimensional knowledge into transferable, actionable mental models.

Not language-first: outputs are symbolic or vector-based

Supports long-term memory storage and adaptive updates

Engineered for interpretability, not just performance

4.  Language Generation
Translates compressed thoughts into language, tailored to the target audience.

Uses a transformer wrapper module (transformers_wrapper.py)

Adjusts tone, detail, and complexity dynamically

Context-aware and non-repetitive

 insight_generator.py houses the generative interface.

Recent Progress
 Added transformer wrapper for modular language interaction

Implemented contextual hybrid modeling with placeholder RL integration

 Modularized pipeline for real-time data ingestion

 Expanded internal representation system for thought-level compression

Introduced prompts.txt for prompt evolution and tracking

 Added edge-friendly API boilerplate scaffolding (planned REST endpoints)

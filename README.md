### Architecture Summary

---

#### **1. Knowledge Nodes**

Modular representations of concepts, systems, and behaviors. Each node includes:

- **Temporal Context**: Time-aware framing of ideas.  
- **Systemic Relationships**: Political, economic, historical interlinks.  
- **Flow Mapping**: Tracks energy, resources, and influence.  
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Incorporates human and system behaviors.

Stored as **multi-dimensional embeddings** to reflect *what*, *why*, and *how* of any concept.

---

#### **2. Cognitive Context Engine (CCE)**

The core reasoning engine that simulates evolving mental models.

- Links new information to existing knowledge  
- Identifies contradictions and cognitive dissonance  
- Recalibrates models and forecasts in real time  
- Outputs interpretable, compressed internal representations

> Located in `cognitive_context_engine.py`

---

#### **3. Thought Compression**

Transforms complex data into actionable, abstract models.

- Symbolic/vector-based representations (not language-first)  
- Designed for **interpretability and adaptability**  
- Facilitates storage in long-term memory modules

---

#### **4. Language Generation**

Translates compressed thoughts into audience-specific language.

- Built on a custom transformer wrapper  
- Context-aware, concise, and non-repetitive  
- Dynamically adjusts tone and depth

> Language interface lives in `insight_generator.py`

---

### Recent Progress

- ✅ Added transformer-based language wrapper  
- ✅ Contextual hybrid modeling with RL placeholders  
- ✅ Modular pipeline for live data ingestion  
- ✅ Expanded thought-level internal compression  
- ✅ Introduced `prompts.txt` for prompt evolution  
- ✅ Created edge-friendly API scaffolding

### Usage Guide

#### 1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas plotly
```

#### 2. Load Knowledge
```python
from data_loader import load_knowledge_data  
data = load_knowledge_data('economic_model.csv')
```

#### 3. Run Cognitive Context Engine
```python
from cognitive_context_engine import CCE  
contextual_thought = CCE.process(data)
```

#### 4. (Optional) Generate Language Output
```python
from insight_generator import generate_language  
output = generate_language(contextual_thought)
```

# **Context-First AGI: Cognitive Context Engine (CCE) Prototype**

## **Overview**
The **Context-First AGI** project is a radical departure from traditional LLM-based models. Rather than focusing on generating language through token prediction, we’re developing a cognitive model that **builds thought before output**. Our goal is to create an AGI that mimics human cognition—understanding and synthesizing complex systems before expressing them in natural language.

## **Core Components**

### 1. **Knowledge Nodes**
- **Description:** These are encapsulated knowledge packets that represent distinct concepts, events, or systems. These nodes include:
  - **Temporal Context**  
  - **Systemic Interactions** (political, economic, historical)  
  - **Resource and Energy Flows**  
  - **Behavioral or Psychological Implications**

- **Purpose:** Each node holds a multi-dimensional representation of a concept, designed to capture not only the *what* but the *why* and *how*.

---

### 2. **Cognitive Context Engine (CCE)**
- **Description:** The engine that processes the incoming nodes, interlinks them, and generates a holistic view of the system. It focuses on:
  - Identifying contradictions  
  - Updating forward projections  
  - Rebalancing priorities  
  - Synthesizing actionable insights based on an evolving world model

- **Purpose:** The CCE acts as the core engine that interprets new data and integrates it into an ongoing world model that adapts with each piece of incoming knowledge.

---

### 3. **Thought Compression**
- **Description:** Once nodes are processed, the system compresses them into **actionable insights** rather than generating linguistic output.
  - These insights are not static—they continuously adapt as new data streams in.

- **Purpose:** The compressed output acts as a **true thought** or mental model, which can then be translated into the language best suited for communication.

---

### 4. **Language Generation**
- **Description:** The final stage where the compressed thought is translated into human-readable language. 
  - Contextually appropriate language is generated based on the specific audience and system requirements.
  - The system is designed to adjust the level of detail and complexity of language based on user needs (e.g., technical, general, strategic).

- **Purpose:** This is the step where output is created, not based on prediction but on **true insight** derived from contextual understanding.

## **How to Use**

### **1. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
# List required libraries for data ingestion, processing, and model training
pip install <library-name>
```

### **2. Input Knowledge:**
Start by feeding your model with knowledge packets. These can be:
- Economic datasets  
- Policy frameworks  
- Historical case studies  
- Any real-world data that fits the system model

### **3. Engage the Cognitive Context Engine:**
Run the `CCE` module to analyze, synthesize, and compress insights.

```python
from cognitive_context_engine import CCE
data = load_knowledge_data('economic_model.csv')
cce_output = CCE.process(data)
```

### **4. Generate Insights:**
Once processed, the compressed thoughts will be available for language generation based on your needs.

```python
from insight_generator import generate_language
language_output = generate_language(cce_output)
```

## **Future Work**
We plan to continue developing this framework, improving the core context engine, expanding data integration capabilities, and fine-tuning the model to ensure more accurate and insightful results.
